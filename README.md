# Asteroids-Game

---------------------------------------------------------------
		ASTEROIDS 2: ASTEROIDS HARDER		                          
---------------------------------------------------------------
-	Asteroids was originally made in 1979 by Atari.	            
-	And I believe the much loved game needed a revamp           
-	along with giving me a learning experience on how           
-	to make my own games.	

-	The aim is to shoot all the asteroids and last as           
-	long as possible. With a life count you get some            
-	help in order to destroy all the endless asteroids          
-	that will come onto the screen.  

- My version of the classic game Asteroids.                   
- This was made as a part of a project.
